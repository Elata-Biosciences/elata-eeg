## Overview
**Open EEG Project** aims to build a **low-cost, open-source EEG machine** for precision psychiatry and neuroscience research. We use a Raspberry Pi (Model 5 recommended) plus a Texas Instruments ADS1299-based amplifier board to acquire 8 channels (or more) of EEG signals at high resolution.  
- **Goal**: Democratize EEG hardware, encourage collaboration, and maintain a fully open, right-to-repair design.  
- **Status**: In early prototyping. Currently able to read/write registers over SPI; next step is real-time data capture and signal processing.

## Hardware Components

1. **Raspberry Pi 5**  
   - CPU: Quad-core Arm Cortex  
   - SPI pins on the 40-pin header  
   - 5-inch or 7-inch HDMI touchscreen (optional but recommended)

2. **ADS1299 EEGFE Board**  
   - 8-channel, 24-bit analog front-end for EEG  
   - Connects to Pi via SPI  
   - TI’s official evaluation module or custom board

3. **EEG Electrodes**  
   - Wet electrodes (Ag/AgCl or Gold Cup)  
   - Conductive paste/gel (e.g., Ten20)

4. **Cables & Adapters**  
   - Dupont jumper wires (2.54 mm pitch) for SPI and power connections  
   - Possible use of additional shielding or ferrite beads

## Software Stack

- **Operating System**: Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)  
- **Rust Toolchain**: Installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)  
- **rppal**: Rust crate for Raspberry Pi GPIO/SPI/I2C/Serial  
- **Logging & Error Handling**: `env_logger`, `anyhow`  
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub  
- **License**: GPLv3 (Strong Copyleft)

- The Pi’s SPI bus communicates with the ADS1299 board to configure channels, read samples, etc.
- Real-time data is processed in Rust (filtering, buffering).
- Output can be saved or displayed locally on Pi’s screen.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Assemble Hardware**
   - Mount the ADS1299 board so it’s accessible to the Pi’s GPIO pins.
   - Connect SPI pins:  
     - `MOSI` (GPIO10) → ADS1299 `SDI`  
     - `MISO` (GPIO9)  → ADS1299 `SDO`  
     - `SCLK` (GPIO11) → ADS1299 `SCLK`  
     - `CS`   (GPIO8)  → ADS1299 `CS`  
     - `GND`  → ADS1299 `GND`  
     - `5V`   → ADS1299 `VDD`, etc. (Check board specs)
   - Attach EEG electrodes to the ADS1299 board inputs.

2. **Install Raspberry Pi OS**
   - Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your PC/Mac.
   - Enable SSH in `raspi-config` or via Pi OS Configuration.

3. **Install Rust & Dependencies**
   - `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential curl`
   - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
   - `source $HOME/.cargo/env`

4. **Clone This Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/open_eeg.git
   cd open_eeg

## Building & Running

1. Compile
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
2. Run
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

3. Expected Behavior
   - On first run, it will attempt to communicate with the ADS1299 registers.
   - You should see debug logs in the console (use `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run` for more details).

## Usage Instructions

1. Electrode Placement
   - Place electrodes on the scalp according to your desired montage (e.g., 10-20 system).
   - Use conductive paste. Ensure good contact and consistent ground/reference electrodes.

2. Real-Time Data Acquisition
   - Currently, the code is in “demo” mode, reading raw samples and printing them to stdout or logs.
   - Future versions will include real-time filtering, a ring buffer, and potential streaming to a local GUI or remote client.

3. Data Logging / Output
   - By default, logs are printed. For CSV logging, we’ll add functionality soon (planned in src/logging.rs).

## Development Notes

- SPI Speed: Currently set to 1_000_000 (1 MHz). You can tweak in src/main.rs if your hardware can handle higher rates.
- ADS1299 Register Map: See TI’s official datasheet. We plan to implement a dedicated driver module in src/ads1299.rs.
- Filtering: A basic IIR or FIR filter is planned. We may integrate a DSP crate for advanced filtering (band-pass, notch, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

1. No SPI Response
   - Check wiring for MOSI/MISO swapped.
   - Ensure dtparam=spi=on in /boot/config.txt (and reboot).

2. Compile Errors
   - Update Rust: rustup update.
   - Confirm Cargo.toml dependencies match in your code.

3. Noise / Poor Signal
   - Add shielding to electrode cables.
   - Keep Pi power supply stable, use quality 5 V, 3 A (or more) adapter.
   - Use short wires for SPI to reduce EMI.
