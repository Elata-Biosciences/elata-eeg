Using python based cadquery to make case

### Install expirience
1) the dsi cable, tricky to install it. go back and forth
2) CAM/DISP1 on the Pi 5 seemed to work better
3) Took multiple attempts even tho everytime seemed the same...
### Ideas
- optional screen?
- handling ads1299. either
 1) ads1299 board case. wrapped in foil, then goes in main case. screw connects foil shield to ground in screw holes?
 2) Or goes in main case, no shielding
- Storage for med tape & small amount of paste
- Open door to wires which are pluuged in?
- Wires out then under so they dont fall out

- foil shielding accross front of case up to lcd
- Reset button
- expose the backlight button of the display
