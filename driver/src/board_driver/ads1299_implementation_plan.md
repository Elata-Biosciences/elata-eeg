# ADS1299 Driver Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the ADS1299 driver for the Elata EEG system.


## 7. Testing Strategy

We'll create tests to validate the driver's functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test SPI communication functions
   - Test register configuration functions
   - Test data conversion functions

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test driver initialization
   - Test acquisition start/stop
   - Test data flow through the EEG system

3. **Hardware Tests**:
   - Test with actual ADS1299EEG_FE board
   - Validate signal quality
   - Measure performance and reliability

## 8. Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Basic Structure and SPI Communication**
   - Create driver structure
   - Implement SPI communication functions
   - Implement register read/write functions

2. **Phase 2: Configuration and Initialization**
   - Implement chip initialization
   - Implement configuration functions
   - Implement single-ended mode setup

3. **Phase 3: Data Acquisition**
   - Implement data reading and conversion
   - Implement acquisition task
   - Integrate with EEG system

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - Write unit tests
   - Test with hardware
   - Refine and optimize

## 9. Dependencies

- rppal: For SPI and GPIO communication
- tokio: For async runtime and synchronization
- Other dependencies already in the project

## 10. Potential Challenges

1. **Timing Issues**: The ADS1299 has specific timing requirements that must be met for reliable operation.
2. **Signal Quality**: Ensuring good signal quality requires careful attention to grounding, shielding, and reference electrode setup.
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is essential for reliable operation in real-world conditions.
4. **Performance**: Ensuring the driver can keep up with high sample rates without dropping data.

## 11. Next Steps

1. Create the `ads1299_driver.rs` file with the basic structure
2. Implement SPI communication functions
3. Implement register configuration functions
4. Test with hardware
