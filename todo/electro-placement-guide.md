Linked Ears Reference (Y-cable, both earlobes to SRB1; bias elsewhere, e.g. Fpz)
Pros:
    Balances left/right artifacts: Averages out noise or muscle artifacts from one side.
    Reduces asymmetrical interference: Can slightly lower environmental or physiological artifacts that affect one ear more.
    Standard for research: Often used in EEG labs for “average reference” effect.
Cons:
    Requires a Y-cable (slightly more setup).

Single Ear Reference (e.g. SRB1 left earlobe, BIAS right earlobe)
Pros:
    Simpler wiring: No Y-cable needed.
    Faster setup.
    Still provides a clean, quiet reference.
Cons:
    May pick up more local artifact: If that ear gets moved/touched or has more noise, it isn’t averaged out.
