## Electro Placement Guide
- Check Electrode Contact: Good contact (gel, minimal motion) helps reduce large offset drifts. Scotch tape can help hold electrodes in place but can also allow some micro motion.
- Give the System Time to Settle: Right after you place electrodes, the offset is often larger. Let the system stabilize for ~30 s or so before recording.

  Active Electrodes (4 sites): Whatever scalp locations you want to record from (e.g., Fp1, Fp2, O1, O2, or T3, T4, etc., depending on your experiment).
    Reference Electrode:
        Linked-Ears Reference: A common practice is to link the left and right earlobes (or mastoids) together via a y‐cable, then feed that combined signal into SRB1 (the reference). This helps balance left/right ear impedances and can reduce some artifacts.
        Or simply pick one ear/mastoid to use as reference for all channels if linking ears is not convenient.
    Bias (Ground) Electrode: A single bias electrode can still be placed on (for example) an earlobe, mastoid, or an Fpz location (low on the forehead, near the hairline).

Rationale:

    All channels can share the same reference electrode (or the same “linked” pair) so signals are measured consistently.
    Using a single bias electrode for all channels simplifies the setup and is standard practice.
