## Session Notes

### Session 1 - 2025-06-18
**Completed:**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Successfully implemented core event-driven infrastructure
- ✅ Created [`crates/device/src/event.rs`](crates/device/src/event.rs:1) with `EegPacket`, `FilteredEegPacket`, and `SensorEvent` types
- ✅ Created [`crates/device/src/plugin.rs`](crates/device/src/plugin.rs:1) with `EegPlugin` trait and plugin management system
- ✅ Created [`crates/device/src/event_bus.rs`](crates/device/src/event_bus.rs:1) with high-performance, non-blocking event distribution
- ✅ Added required dependencies (`anyhow`, `tracing`) to [`Cargo.toml`](crates/device/Cargo.toml:1)
- ✅ Updated [`lib.rs`](crates/device/src/lib.rs:1) to expose new modules
- ✅ **Build Success**: `cargo check` passes with only warnings (no errors)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Used `Arc<[f32]>` for zero-copy data sharing as planned
- Implemented back-pressure handling with `try_send` and capacity checks
- Added comprehensive event filtering system for plugins
- Included extensive test coverage for all core components
- Added metrics tracking for event bus performance monitoring

**Next Session Goals:**
- Start **Phase 2**: Refactor [`main.rs`](crates/device/src/main.rs:1) to orchestrate plugins
- Implement plugin supervisor with restart logic
- Create data acquisition loop with event broadcasting
- Add graceful shutdown handling with `CancellationToken`

**Blockers/Issues:**
- None - Phase 1 implementation is complete and building successfully

### Session 2 - 2025-06-18
**Completed:**
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Successfully refactored [`main.rs`](crates/device/src/main.rs:1) for event-driven architecture
- ✅ Added EventBus and CancellationToken initialization
- ✅ Implemented plugin supervisor with exponential backoff and restart logic
- ✅ Created data acquisition loop that converts ProcessedData to SensorEvents
- ✅ Added graceful shutdown handling with proper task cleanup
- ✅ Integrated event-driven system with existing WebSocket server
- ✅ Replaced println! with structured tracing logging
- ✅ **Build Success**: `cargo check` passes with only warnings (no errors)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Event-driven main loop with prioritized shutdown signal handling
- Dual-mode operation: new event system alongside legacy processing (for Phase 4 removal)
- Proper task supervision and cleanup on shutdown
- Zero-copy data conversion from ProcessedData to EegPacket events
- Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

**Next Session Goals:**
- Start **Phase 3**: Convert existing logic into plugins
